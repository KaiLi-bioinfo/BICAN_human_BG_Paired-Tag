Paired-Tag single-cell multi-omics profiling of histone modifications and RNA expression in the human basal ganglia.

## Overview
The basal ganglia are essential subcortical hubs that coordinate movement, cognition, and affect, and are deeply implicated in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Despite their importance, the regulatory logic that establishes and maintains basal ganglia cell-type identity remains poorly characterized, limiting our ability to interpret non-coding genetic risk variants linked to brain disease.

This repository supports a comprehensive single-cell Paired-Tag study of the adult human basal ganglia, integrating histone modification profiles with transcriptomic measurements across multiple anatomically defined regions. By jointly analyzing chromatin states and gene expression, the study delineates cell-type-resolved regulatory programs, including the selective deployment of activating and repressive regulatory elements and transcription factor networks underlying neuronal identity. Spatial transcriptomic data from matched regions further reveal regional and cellular heterogeneity in epigenomic organization. Comparative analyses between human and mouse highlight a dichotomy in evolutionary constraint, with core neuronal regulatory circuits conserved while inducible regulatory programs show substantial divergence. Together, this atlas provides a foundation for linking basal ganglia cell types to neuropsychiatric disease risk and for developing predictive models of regulatory element function and variant impact.

## Data
Raw sequencing data are available through controlled-access repositories. Processed data objects are described in the analysis notebooks.
